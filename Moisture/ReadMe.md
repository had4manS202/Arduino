# 🌱 Arduino Uno + Soil Moisture Sensor Project

This project demonstrates how to use a Soil Moisture Sensor with an Arduino Uno to monitor the moisture level of soil. It's ideal for smart irrigation, plant care, or home gardening automation.

## 📦 Components

- Arduino Uno
- Soil Moisture Sensor (FC-28 or Capacitive)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- USB cable or external power
- (Optional) LED or buzzer for alerts

## ⚙️ How It Works

The sensor measures the moisture content in the soil and sends an analog signal to the Arduino. Based on this value, you can determine whether the soil is dry, moist, or wet.
